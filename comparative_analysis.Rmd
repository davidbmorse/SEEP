## Analysis Comparing Spatial Transcriptomic Data of the Spheroid, Organoid, and PDX-biopsy samples

This is an R Markdown document going over the code necessary to compare the data across the three model systmes studied during the SEEP project.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
