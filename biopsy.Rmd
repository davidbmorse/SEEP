## PDX-biopsy Analysis Overview

This is an R Markdown document going over the code necessary to analyz the PDX-biopsy data generated during the SEEP project.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
